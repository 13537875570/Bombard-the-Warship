This is a game of bombarding a warship within a 2-D map. 
This game implements Dynamic Programming and Recursive method. 
This project is created based on Eclipse, Javafx. Your computer has to support Eclipse or Javafx to run the code. 
There is 3 main code files that you can run: 
1.FireCommonMode.java, which you can enjoy the original game without interference if you want. 
2.FireDP, which shows you how "Dynamic Programming Top-Down and Bottom Up" running with changing in cells values. 
3.FireRecursive, which shows you how "recursive method" solves the problem. 
When you find "You can change this for..." in the codes, you can change that integer value to any n(2<=n<=100). Make sure that do not let ship length exceed map length or map width when changing!!!
Enjoy you time on this game!
